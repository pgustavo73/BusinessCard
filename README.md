# Kotlin Business Card App
Hello welcome

This was the project delivered at the Inter-Bank Bootcamp at DIO.

The objective of the project is to create a business card list application where it is possible to keep the name, company, contact phone, email, and card background color data using the Room database.

In this project, View Binding, Room, MVVM, LiveData, ListAdapter, Material Desing were used.

Added the feature to Remove the Card.

Feel free to look, I am open to tips and suggestions.
